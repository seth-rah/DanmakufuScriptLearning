## Prerequisites

These scripts are compatible with ph3 which can be downloaded from here: https://touhougc.web.fc2.com/products/th_dnh_ph3.html

The version these scripts were tested with can be found here: https://ux.getuploader.com/touhougc/download/4

This installation assumes that the location of the default scripts that come with the initial installation are unchanged, as the directories have been specified as absolute.

## Install

To make use of the scripts, merge the contents of this repository into the Danmakufu `/script` directory.

Running Danmakufu after completing this, should make the script runnable from within.
